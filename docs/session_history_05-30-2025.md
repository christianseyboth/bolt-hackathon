    -   Updated `package.json` to include new `@radix-ui/react-*` dependencies and `recharts`.
    -   Modified `src/components/ui/button.tsx` to integrate custom variants.

## Application-wide Changes

-   **Layout Modifications:**
    -   `src/app/layout.tsx`: Removed `NavBar` and `Footer` from the root layout to allow for different layouts (marketing vs. dashboard).
    -   `src/app/(marketing)/layout.tsx`: Wrapped marketing pages with `NavBar` and `Footer`.

    -   Injected `BlogLayout` component code directly into several `.mdx` blog files (`changelog-for-2024/page.mdx`, `cool-things-to-do-with-ai/page.mdx`, `how-companies-are-working-without-ai/page.mdx`, `top-5-llm-of-all-time/page.mdx`, `what-is-social-media-marketing/page.mdx`). This is a temporary measure for demonstration purposes and would ideally be refactored into a shared component.
